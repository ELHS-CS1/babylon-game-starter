# TypeScript and Linting Enforcement

- Agents must generate code compliant with TypeScript `strict` mode enabled.
- ESLint should run on all changed `.ts` files with configuration from `.eslintrc.json`.
- Fail workflow if linting errors or TypeScript compile errors occur.
- Use prettier rules as configured in `.prettierrc` for formatting.
