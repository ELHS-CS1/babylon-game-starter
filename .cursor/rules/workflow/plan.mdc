# General Workflow Standards

- Always include a header comment with author and date in new files.
- Follow PSR-12 (or your project's style guide) for formatting and naming.
- Unit tests must accompany new TypeScript modules.
- Tests must pass before code is merged.
- Documentation comments should follow Google-style for functions and classes.

✅ NO TS ANY
✅ NO TYPE CASTING
✅ NO TIMEOUTS
✅ NO LOGS
✅ Fully type-safe
✅ No name based filtering. Metadata property filtering preferred.
✅ Always consider whether an update to any README.md or other markdown file is warranted.
